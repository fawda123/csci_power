# Function:    trend.se.fcn
# Programmer:  Tom Kincaid
# Date:        April 11, 2003
# Description:
#   This function calculates the standard error for trend for a design.
#   Input:
#	  nsites = a matrix (dimensions: number of panels (rows) by number of years 
#         (columns)) containing the number of sites visited for each combination 
#         of panel and year
#	  nrepeats = either a single number or a matrix the same dimension as
#         nsites specifying the number of revisits to the sites in a panel for a
#         year, where a single number indicates a fixed number of revisits for
#         all years.  The default is 1.
#      site.var = the variance component estimate for site.  Tthe default is 0.
#      year.var = the variance component estimate for year.  The default is 0.
#      site.year.var = the variance component estimate for site by year 
#         interaction.  The default is 0.
#      index.var = the variance component estimate for index error.  The default 
#         is 0.
#	  site.rho = site correlation across years.  The default is 1.
#	  year.rho = year autocorrelation.  The default is 0.
#   Output:
#      The standard error for trend for a design.
